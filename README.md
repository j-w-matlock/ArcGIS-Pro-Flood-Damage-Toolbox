# ArcGIS-Pro-Flood-Damage-Toolbox
A toolbox to estimate agricultural flood damages in ArcGIS Pro. The tool
automatically lists the top 20 crop codes found in the selected cropland
raster and all uploaded flood depth rasters. Users simply enter a value
per acre, growing season, month and return period for each row before
running the analysis.
